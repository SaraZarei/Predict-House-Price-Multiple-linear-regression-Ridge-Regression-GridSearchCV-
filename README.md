In this notebook after cleaning and preprocessing and exploratory on data I developed 3 models and got R-squared for all of them.At first  with **multiple  linear regression** on all data without split data and  then I defined a **polynomial function on multiple features** and find best order for polynomial function.Then I developed a **Ridge regression** with define a  hyperparameter for control magnetitude coefficients in function and  used **GrisSearchCV** method for finding best hyperparameter for RidgeRegression
